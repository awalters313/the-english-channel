Final assignment for CodeFellows Foundations Class.

This website is home to a House of Cards puzzle. The user can scramble the pieces and then drag and drop them to match the initial image.

The images were borrowed from several sites found through a Google search, as were some pieces of code. The images came from scott-oconnor.com and Squarespace, as well as digtaltrends.com. The borrowed code includes: the resize function, from mozilla.org; the font, from typekit.com; the refresh function for the 'solve' button, from stackoverflow.com; and the code for shuffling, which was Brook's code, just slightly modified.

Also referenced were several Google Libraries, specifically for the jQuery and jQuery UI.
